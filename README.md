# letterShuffler

WHAT: Animated letter-shuffler in vanilla JS. 

HOW: Attach the ID "shuffleThis" to whatever text element that you want animated. A random letter of the text element at a time will be shuffled through rapidly, creating a glitchy letter effect. 

Tweak animation speed by changing values of the variables interationSpeed, shortDelay & longDelay

A monospace typeface is recommended.
